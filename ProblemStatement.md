## Library Management System - Problem Statement

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive Library   System that demonstrates all major Java OOP concepts and design patterns. 
This is a console-based application that should showcase your understanding of object-oriented design principles.

## Phase 1 

## Core Requirements
### Focus: Encapsulation, Basic Classes, Object Relationships

## User Stories:
1. As a librarian, I want to add new books to the library system
2. As a librarian, I want to register new library members
3. As a member, I want to search for books by title or author
4. As a member, I want to view my borrowing history

## Reflection
1. As of now all of the functionaliy is implemented in the library system , it has all of the functions
As the actors , librarian and as an member the actions are not implemented, I have some idea as to how we can implement 
that but will want for the phase 2 completion and then come back to it. [TODO]
2. Defined an interface named Librarian with given two functions, but the LibrarySystem needs to implement librarian 
but that sounds logically incorrect.Technically it should be a librarian having access to librarySystem. Still not very clear on this. Need to ponder and get clarity



## Forward thinking (Possible future enhancements)
1. Search Optimization 
2. Access rules
3. Persistence layer
4. Caching 
5. Audit logs for book actions
